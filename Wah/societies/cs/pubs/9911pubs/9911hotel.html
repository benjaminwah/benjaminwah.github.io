    <p>Please plan your agendas with a lunch break between 12
    noon and 1:00 p.m. for a central buffet-style function that
    will be scheduled each day (Tuesday through Thursday) for all
    meetings week attendees. The only information you need to
    provide is a <b>confirmed headcount</b> for your group when
    you return the<i> Meeting Request Form</i>. Continental
    breakfasts and beverage breaks can still be made on an
    individual meeting basis. Note any special dietary
    requirements (i.e., vegetarian, low salt, low cholesterol, no
    MSG), in the space provided on the <i>Meeting Request Form</i>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>AGENDA BOOK</b></font></p>
    <p>If your name appears on the <a href="rptlist.htm"><strong><i>Agenda
    Book</i></strong><strong> report writers list</strong></a>,
    please submit your activity updates or any other <i>Agenda
    Book</i> materials to the headquarters office via regular or
    electronic mail (l.harris@computer.org) <b>close of business
    by FRIDAY 22 October 1999</b>shipping requests . Please limit
    all activity reports to <u>one page or less</u>. Special and
    address changes should be sent to me <b>prior to the 5
    November 1999 mailing date</b>.</p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>MEETING SUPPORT</b></font></p>
    <p>A <a href="mtgreq.htm"><strong><i>Meeting Request Form</i></strong></a>
    is provided to simplify your preparation for the meeting.
    Please return the form by <b>Friday 22 October</b> <b>1999</b>
    even if you have a <i>&quot;regularly scheduled meeting&quot;</i>
    in order that all meal details and audiovisual equipment
    expectations may be considered. <strong>[NOTE: If your
    meeting requires the use of an In Focus projector, please
    note this on the </strong><strong><i>Meeting Request Form</i></strong><strong>.
    We will bring three projectors to the meetings but their use
    will be on a first come, first serve basis. Digital
    projectors are prohibitively expensive to rent on-site.] </strong></p>
    <p>We recommend a conservative head count estimate for your
    functions as the hotel will include a 5% overage on beverage
    breaks and buffet type setups. Photocopying at the meeting
    site is always expensive, so we ask that you copy all
    materials and bring them with you. If no copying facilities
    are available to you, please send your materials to the
    society headquarters office <b>no later than 5 November 1999</b>.
    Our staff will be happy to copy and bring them to the
    meeting.</p>
