  the Computer Society should provide our members easy access to current and concise
  technical information, facilitate personal interactions among our members through
  conferences and chapter activities, and bring new technologies to our members steps
  ahead of other sources, using means like distance learning, lifelong education,
  and self-advancement. My goal as president is to carry out this vision and help
  our members maintain a competitive edge. The Society, as the major provider of
  technical information in the computer profession, is in a pivotal position to lead
  this effort. With your help, I will emphasize<BR clear="left"></P>

      <P align="JUSTIFY">Guiding the Society to make it a learning community by facilitating
      fast dissemination and sharing of knowledge through journals, conferences,
      tutorials, seminars, technical committees, and chapter activities. We must
      keep our members abreast of new advances and help them overcome obsolescence
      through reviews and surveys from well-known experts and visionaries so that&nbsp;they
      can meet their daily challenges of rapidly advancing computer and communication
      technologies. We would invest in new tools to send relevant and concise technical
      information and trends to our members through the Internet. Using interactive
      distance learning, we would constantly strive for new ways of delivering timely
      and easily understandable technical reviews, surveys, and tutorials to members.</P>

      <P align="JUSTIFY">Promoting publications, conferences, and services for our
      practitioner members who need to stay attuned to changing technologies and
      continuously expand their technical expertise. We must develop new publications
      and services in emerging areas and improve our current offerings to serve our
      members’ needs. I will work with Society program boards to help bridge the
      gap between theory and practice.</P>
