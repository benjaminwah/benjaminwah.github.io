<b><i>Position statement.</i></b> The mission of the Computer Society is to advance
the theory, practice, and application of computer and information processing science
and technology. The society faces a lot of challenges with the rapid and continuous
growth of the computer industry.

<p>
To better serve our members, our products and services must be responsive to the diverse
needs of its membership worldwide, the computing profession, and the computer industry.
If elected, I will emphasize the following goals:

<ul>
<li><i>Promote technology transfers to help members stay attuned to changing technology</i>.
Because most of our members are practitioners,
it is important to develop products and services to serve their needs. To this end,
I will provide leadership to develop programs, products, and services that
focus on technology transfer and bridging the gap from theory to practice.
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Educate computer professionals to overcome obsolescence</i>.
With ever-changing computer technologies, it is important for computer
professionals to keep abreast of new developments and knowledge in the field.
To maintain the longevity of the computer profession and to help computer
professionals move into the forefront of computer technologies, I will provide
leadership to develop material for online learning using Web-based technologies
and courses/professional development seminars.
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Develop strategies, products, and services to promote membership worldwide</i>.
With more than a third of our members residing outside the US and with economic
and technical growth in Pacific Rim and East European countries, the Computer Society
must increase its global impact as well as utilize opportunities in delivering new
products and services. There are large international markets with growing needs for
new technologies to be tapped. I will provide leadership to develop effective and
economic ways to deliver workshops, conferences, electronic subscriptions,
and membership services to these regions.
</ul>
<p>
I will be honored to serve you as Second Vice President. If elected, I
will set directions to lead the Computer Society into the 21st century.
Please vote.
