In my vision, the
IEEE will provide our members easy access to current and concise technical
information, facilitate interactions through conferences and regional
activities, and bring new technologies to our members, steps ahead of other
sources. As vice president for TAB, my goal is to carry out this vision and help
our members maintain a competitive edge, using means like distance learning. To
fulfill the mission of the IEEE and reduce the technology gap of our members, I
will represent your interest and emphasize the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin-top:1; margin-bottom:0">
Guiding the IEEE into a learning community through journals, electronic 
conferences, Web-based tutorials, seminars, virtual communities, section 
meetings and regional activities. We will be exploring ways and means to rapidly 
update our members' knowledge in new and fast developing areas and help our members overcome obsolescence 
and meet their daily challenges of rapidly advancing technologies. We will do 
this through reviews and surveys from well-known experts, as well as discussions 
in conference panels and invited speeches that will be made available 
electronically beyond conferences. Using interactive distance learning, we will 
bring conferences to members' homes and strive for new ways of delivering timely 
and easily understandable information to&nbsp; our members according to their 
technological interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 8; margin-bottom: 0">Promoting publications,
  conferences, and services for our practitioner members who need to stay
  attuned to changing technologies and continuously expand their technical
  expertise. We must develop new publications and services in emerging areas and
  improve our current offerings to serve our practitioner and student members’
  needs. I will work with society program boards to bridge the gap between
  theory and practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 8; margin-bottom: 0">Developing plans to better serve
  our regular and student members worldwide. We need more effective and
  economical methods to deliver workshops, conferences, publications, digital
  libraries, and services to our worldwide members. We must bring all our global
  members to closer collaboration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 8; margin-bottom: 0">Leading the IEEE through sound financial management
practices and better cooperation among societies and councils. In addition, I
will work hard to represent the interests of our members by reducing the costs
of products and services, especially those unemployed and with low income.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">I have served the IEEE-CS since 1978 and have been active in
TAB in the last six years. In particular, I have demonstrated my leadership
ability in serving as the IEEE-CS President in 2001, during which I managed an
annual budget of $33 million, a membership of nearly 100,000, and many diverse
activities in publications, conferences, standards, education, and international
cooperation. To illustrate my abilities, the following are three projects that I
helped initiate in 2001.</p>
<b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">First, we launched the <i>Total Information Provider Project</i>,
the master plan of IEEE-CS’ electronic future in the coming years. The project
was in response to member requests for concise, relevant, and up-to-date
technical material in digital format in diverse topical areas. It provides a
method of offering broader content from within the total scope of computing
literature and for synthesizing that information to focus on specific technical
areas. It also offers tools to help members address their problem of information
overload and their need for access to essential and timely information with
anywhere, anytime delivery.</p>
<b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">Second, we developed in 2001 a new distance learning
initiative to significantly enhance the value of IEEE-CS membership. To energize
educational activities, we started offering all IEEE-CS members free access to
hundreds of hours of professionally developed IT-related courses via the
Internet. The project was highly successful, leading to increased membership in
2002.</p>
<b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">Third, we developed strategic partnerships with other IEEE
entities in order to enhance member services. We also helped resolve many
differences between IEEE and IEEE-CS that arose in the past few years.</p>
<b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">My other significant activities in the IEEE include the
co-founding of the <i>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</i> in
1988 and serving as its EIC between 1993-96, serving as the IEEE-CS Vice
President for Publications between 1998-99, leading the initiation of the <i>IEEE</i>
<i>Transactions on Mobile Computing</i> and <i>IEEE</i> <i>Pervasive Computing</i>
in 2001, serving as an AdCom member in the IEEE Neural Network Council for eight
years, serving as an IEEE-CS Board of Governors member for eight years, and
serving as conference and program chairs of numerous IEEE conferences.</p>

<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin: 0">In my professional career, I am the 
first holder of the Robert T. Chien Professor of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana, where I have taught since 
1985.&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, I taught for six years at Purdue
University. I served as a program director at the National Science Foundation
between 1988 and 1989. I have supervised 16 Ph.D. and 19 M.S. theses.&nbsp; My 
interests are in computer and communications, including software engineering and 
Internet-based applications. My research is inter-disciplinary and covers areas in
multimedia signal processing, computer networks, neural networks, and nonlinear
optimization. </p>

<p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
I will be honored to serve you as Vice President and will be available to you 
for interactions and advice. Please feel free to suggest to the IEEE how we can 
serve you better.</p>
