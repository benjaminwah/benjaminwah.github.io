</h3>

<p>The mission of the Computer Society is to advance the theory, practice,
and application of computer and information processing science and technology.
To achieve this mission and to better serve our members, we must address the
rapid growth of the computer industry. Moreover, we must be responsive to the
diverse needs of its worldwide membership and the computing profession.  If
elected, I will emphasize the following items: 

<ul>
<li><i>Guide the Computer Society to make it a learning community by facilitating
the rapid dissemination and sharing of knowledge, through journals,
conferences, and seminars</i>.  This helps our members to overcome obsolescence
with rapidly changing computer and communication technologies.  Computer
Society should provide education through local chapters and interactive
learning through the Internet.  Our journals should consolidate to provide
timely technical reviews, surveys, and tutorials.
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Promote publications, conferences, and services such that our current
and targeted members can stay attuned to changing technology and continuously
expand their technical expertise</i>. Because many members are practitioners,
we must develop new publications and services, and improve our current
offerings to serve their needs. Accordingly, I will work with society
volunteers on different program boards to develop strategic directions to
help bridge the gap from theory to practice. This will go a long way in
helping members keep up with new technologies. 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Develop publications and services to serve both regular and student
membership worldwide</i>. With rapid growth in technologies in Pacific Rim
and East European countries, large international markets increasingly in
need of new technologies are waiting to be tapped.  I plan to work with
volunteers to develop effective and economic ways to deliver workshops,
conferences, publications, digital libraries, and membership services to
these regions.  The Computer Society must utilize such opportunities to
increase its global presence and impact, and bring all society members to
closer collaboration.
</ul>
<p>I will achieve these goals through increased (regular and student) membership,
reduced dues, and cost reduction.  I will be honored to serve you as first vice
president and lead the Computer Society into the next century.  Please vote.
