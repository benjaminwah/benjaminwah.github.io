<h2><b>The <i>Teacher</i> Learning System Project</b></h2>
</center>

<p>The design of good heuristics is important in many engineering applications.
Today, many application problems are too complex for users to find optimal
algorithms analytically.  Rather, users rely on heuristics designed by experts
to find high-quality solutions.  The effectiveness of these heuristics, however,
depends on domain knowledge available to and past experience of these experts.
When little domain knowledge is available, it is important to develop
automated learning methods for generating improved heuristics systematically,
evaluating their performance on realistic test cases, and generalizing their
performance to test cases not seen in learning.  Such learning and generalization
methods will carry significant impact in many engineering applications.

<p>The objective of the <i>Teacher</i> (<b>TE</b>chniques for the <b>A</b>utomated <b>C</b>reation of <b>HE</b>u<b>R</b>istics)
Project is to automate the learning and generalization of performance-related heuristics for
knowledge-lean application problems.  To find robust and better heuristics
that perform well under a wide variety of conditions, issues on performance
evaluation, generalization, generalizability, and resource scheduling must be studied.</p>

	Generalizability</a>:
		This involves finding heuristics that perform better than
		other competing heuristics across test cases of different
		statistical behavior in an application.
		Traditional statistical methods, which generally require performance
		data to be independent and identically distributed, cannot be applied.
		A new statistical measure called <i>probability of win</i> was
		developed to assess the performance of heuristics in a
		range-independent and distribution-independent manner.
		This generalization method has led to many new and robust 
		heuristics that perform better than existing heuristics.<p>

	<li><a HREF="paper.html#GENETIC" target="resview">
	Resource Scheduling</a>:
		This involves scheduling (sequential and parallel) computing
		resources in genetics-based learning so that high-quality
		heuristics can be learned in a limited amount of time.
		This problem was largely ignored in the literature in the past
		but is extremely important in real applications in which tests
		of heuristics are expensive.
		A number of efficient resource scheduling algorithms have been
		developed to trade between the number of new heuristic methods
		considered and the amount of tests performed on each.<p>

	<p>Improvements in these problem solvers are very hard because they have been
	tuned extensively by their designers.  In each application, <i>Teacher</i>
	was able to find improvements ranging from 5% to
	several orders of magnitude.<p>
