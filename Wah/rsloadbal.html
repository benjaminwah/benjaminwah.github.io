<b>Distributed Processing and Networking</b></h2></center>

<p>Our focus in this area is in the application of distributed search
methods to resolve collisions and to identify bottlenecks in distributed
systems and computer networks, and the design of efficient protocols for
real-time transmissions.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#REALTIMENET">Real-Time Multimedia Loss Concealment</a>.
	The research aims to design protocols and coding methods for the concealment of errors
	that occur during real-time transmission of audio and video data over unreliable IP networks,
	such as the Internet and wireless networks.  Since video and audio transmissions may tolerate
	some degree of loss, it is necessary to study schemes that involve trade-offs in their
	real-time requirements and tolerance to loss.  The schemes studied will involve proper
	coding of transmitted data, protocols to schedule transmissions and feedbacks, and
	reconstruction schemes to recover lost data.  Results of this research will lead to
	more robust transmissions of real-time video and audio data over unreliable networks.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#WINDOW"> Multiaccess problem: the search for a single responding station</a>.
	The multiaccess problem, or the identification of a single station
	to use a shared channel, is an important problem in local-area
	and mobile networks.  Although the number of contention slots
	needed to resolve contention in the original binary backoff algorithm
	grows linearly with respect to the number of contending stations,
	the variance of inter-channel access delays grows very quickly
	with increasing number of contending stations.  Consequently, the
	number of contending stations in such networks must be kept
	very small.</p>

	<p>We have developed an efficient collision-resolution algorithm for
	multiaccess networks with a geometrically distributed inter-channel
	access delay and an average delay that is constant, independent of
	the number of contending stations.
	In this protocol, each station chooses a random number in a common
	range, and stations inside a common window can contend for the
	channel in the next contention slot.  By reducing the common window
	successively using dynamic programming, a single station will eventually
	be isolated.  The speed of the protocol can be improved by storing
	the optimal window in each step ahead of time in lookup tables.
	A U.S. patent on this invention was awarded in 1986.
	The protocol has also been extended to use in mobile networks.</p>

	<p>The window-based scheme for contention resolution was extended to
	work in multiprocessor bus networks and networks with multiple
	contention busses.  A variation of this algorithm was implemented
	in the Sequent Balance 8000 multiprocessor.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#LOADPROT">
Load balancing problem: the search for stations with the minimum and the maximum load</a>.
	By implementing the window protocol in software, load balancing
	can be carried out effectively in software in local-area networks.
	The window protocol implemented in software can find stations
	with the maximum and the minimum workload in constant time on the
	average, independent of the number of contending stations.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#LOADNOW">
Load balancing strategies: learning and generalization</a>.
	Using evolutionary learning, new load balancing strategies
	were created, verified on a real system, and generalized
	to systems not tested in learning.  The key issue involves
	the development of an
	experimental system that allows load balancing strategies with
	different parameters to be tested under identical workload
	conditions.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#APPLLOAD">
Load balancing: applications</a>.
	The mapping of neural-network learning on distributed-memory
	multiprocessors has been studied.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#REALTIMENET">
Protocols for real time transmissions</a>.
	In this area we study efficient protocols and related performance
	issues to transmit real-time data over computer networks.  We study
	related issues in quality of service, protocols for efficient
	audio, image, and data coding and reconstruction, and the implementation
	and testing of these protocols on prototypes.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#RESOURCE">
Resource sharing interconnection networks: the distributed search
for free resources of a specific type</a>.
	The problem involves the design of architectural supports
	in a multistage interconnection network to search for free
	resources of a specific type to satisfy incoming requests.
	The problem has been transformed into a maximum-flow problem
	that can be solved in polynomial time.  Hardware implementations
	of the distributed maximum-flow problem have also been studied.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#DDB">
Distributed databases</a>.
	The main applications studied are the file-placement
	problem and the use of a broadcast bus to aid distributed
	query processing and concurrency control in distributed
	databases.</p>

<li><a HREF="paper.html#OAPPL">
Other protocols and applications</a>.
	Miscellaneous and protocols and applications have been studied, specifically,
	distributed search on the Internet.
